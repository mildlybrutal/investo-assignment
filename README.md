## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [radix-ui](https://www.radix-ui.com/)- For additional styles

## What I learned

While working on this project, I learned the following:

- **Responsive Design**: Implementing responsive layouts using Tailwind CSS and React hooks like `useIsMobile` to dynamically adjust components based on screen size.
- **Custom Slider**: Using Tailwind animations, Built a custom slider which changes values
- **Dynamic Styling**: Leveraging Tailwind's utility classes and custom CSS variables to create dynamic and theme-aware styles.


### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to focus on:

- **Improving Accessibility**: Ensuring all components are fully accessible, including proper ARIA roles and keyboard navigation.
- **Performance Optimization**: Reducing bundle size and improving load times by optimizing imports and using code-splitting techniques.
- **Advanced State Management**: Exploring state management libraries like Zustand or Redux for more complex applications.
